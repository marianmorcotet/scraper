Coolio: Michelle Pfeiffer and Snoop Dogg lead tributes to Gangsta's Paradise rapper

Stars including Michelle Pfeiffer and Snoop Dogg have been paying tribute to the US rapper Coolio who has died at the age of 59.
He was found unresponsive on the bathroom floor of a friend's LA house, his manager Jarez Posey told US media.
Coolio, whose real name is Artis Leon Ivey Jr, won a Grammy for the 1995 track Gangsta's Paradise, which led the soundtrack for Dangerous Minds.

The exact cause of his death on Wednesday has not yet been revealed.
However Mr Posey told TMZ, which first reported the news, that paramedics believed he may have had a cardiac arrest.
Coolio's manager at Trinity Artists International, Sheila Finegan, said they were "saddened... he touched the world with the gift of his talent and will be missed profoundly".
Pfeiffer said she thought Coolio's track was the "reason our film saw so much success" and that she still gets "chills" whenever she hears it.
"Heartbroken to hear of the passing of the gifted artist Coolio," she wrote on Instagram, sharing a clip from the famous music video, which sees her sitting across the table from Coolio as he raps.
"A life cut entirely too short," she continued. "I remember him being nothing but gracious." 
Dangerous Minds saw Pfeiffer play an ex-Marine who becomes a teacher working on a pilot programme for teenagers who are bright but underachieving, in a tough, inner-city school.
Coolio's haunting track from it, which samples the Stevie Wonder song Pastime Paradise, continues to be widely listened to and has just passed a billion streams on Spotify, according to his official website.

Gangsta's Paradise went on to become one of the most successful rap songs of all-time, helping to bring the genre into the mainstream. 
The name Coolio came from a friend who asked him, "Who do you think you are, Coolio Iglesias?",

Coolio started making music in the 80s, but he cemented his place in hip-hop history when he recorded Gangsta's Paradise, which went on to become one of the most successful rap songs of all time.
A leading figure in the US West Coast rap music scene in the 90s, Coolio was born in Pennsylvania, but grew up in the LA suburb of Compton, where his career flourished.
He worked as a volunteer firefighter in the San Jose area before dedicated himself full-time to hip-hop.
He told the Los Angeles Times
"In firefighting training was discipline I needed," he said. "We ran every day. I wasn't drinking or smoking or doing the stuff I usually did."
He rejected the label gangster rapper, and instead embraced the role of an all-round entertainer.
A talented producer and actor, he appeared in dozens of films and TV shows, including Celebrity Big Brother in the UK in 2009.
And he even found an outlet for his love of food with a book and internet series, Cooking with Coolio.
Over a career spanning four decades he recorded eight studio albums and won an American Music Award and three MTV Video Music Awards.
His other hits included Fantastic Voyage, Rollin' With My Homies, 1, 2, 3, 4 (Sumpin' New), and Too Hot.
He was active right up until his death - Coolio was in the middle of a tour with other 90s stars including Vanilla Ice and Young MC, and they performed in Texas just a few days ago.
Coolio had four children with ex-wife Josefa Salinas, whom he married in 1996 and later divorced. A complete list of his family was not immediately available.
